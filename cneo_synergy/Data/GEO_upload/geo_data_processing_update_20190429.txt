Quality Control: Sequencing reads for all samples were assessed for quality using FastQC (version 0.10.1; www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). All samples had an average Phred score of 30 or greater.
Mapping: Reads reads were mapped against the C. neoformans H99 genome using HISAT2 (version 2.1.0; Kim, Langmead, & Salzberg, 2015. Nature Methods, 12(4), 357–360) with following settings: “hisat2 -p 4 --known-splicesite-infile splicesites.txt -x $INDEX_DIR -1 ${job_name}_R1.fastq.gz -2 ${job_name}_R2.fastq.gz -S ${job_name}.sam”. The splicesites.txt file contained a list of splice sites and was generated using the command "python hisat2_extract_splice_sites.py genes.gtf > splicesites.txt". hisat2_extract_splice_sites.py was a script included in the HISAT2 package and genes.gtf is a gene annotation file.
Counting: The number of unique reads were calculated using the featureCount function of Subread (version 1.6.4; Liao, Smyth & Shi. 2014 Bioinformatics, 30(7):923–930.) and the C. neoformans var. grubii H99 CNA3 gene annotation GTF file (RefSeq accession: GCF_000149245.1) . The following featureCounts settings were used: “featureCounts -s 0 -T 12 -p -a $GTF_FILE -t CDS -g gene_id -o ${job_name}_featurecounts.txt ${job_name}.sorted.bam”.
Differentially expressed genes: Genes with low raw read counts were removed and only genes at least one counts per million (cpm) for at least six samples were kept for analysis. Differential expression of genes was analysed using in R (version 3.5.3) and the edgeR library (version 3.24.3) (Robinson, McCarthy, & Smyth, 2010 Bioinformatics, 26(1), 139–140). Multiple dimension scaling was used to examine the similarity in read counts between the samples and to assess reproducibility of the replicates. The sample 5A was identified as an outlier and were discarded from further analyses. The samples were normalized with respect to the library size and tag-wise biological coefficient of variation. Signifcantly differentially expressed genes was idenified using the quasi-likelihood methods (e.g. glmQLFit and glmQLFTest). A Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05 was used as the cutoff for identifying differentially expressed genes. To identify the genes that are differentially expressed upon synergistic amphotericin B (AMB) and lactoferrin (LF) treatment, C. neofrmans cultures were treated with i) AMB only; ii) a growth control for (i) with no AMB treatment; iii) a synergistic combination of AMB + LF; and iv) a growth control for (iii) with no AMB-LF treatment. For the analysis of treatments (i) to (iv), biological triplicate RNA-Seq samples were analyzed for the four treatments, with 12 samples in total. The AMB treatment was compared with the matched control, abbreviated as ‘AMB only’ treatment. The AMB + LF treatment was compared with its matched control, abbreviated as ‘AMB+LF’ treatment.
