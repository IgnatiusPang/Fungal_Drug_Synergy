## Supplementary Information 

*C. neoformans* and *S. cerevisiae* orthologs information are located in this [link](cneo_synergy/Data/Curated_Data/scer_cneo_orthologs.tab). Those in reliability class 1 were identified using BlastP reciprocal top-hits and are one-to-one orthologs. Those in reliability class 2 were orthologs from OrthoMCL, these are not necessarily one-to-one orthologs but could be.
